# Pavlo Mysak

This is the source code for my personal website and technical portfolio, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## 🧭 About the Site

This site serves as both a portfolio and a learning journal.  
You’ll find:

- **Projects:** short write-ups on machine learning and data science projects  
- **Journals:** personal notes and reflections on concepts I’m studying  
- **About:** background on my education, work, and interests  

The site uses the minimalist [jekyll-theme-minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) theme with a few custom layouts for posts and navigation.
